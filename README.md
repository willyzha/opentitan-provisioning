# OpenTitan Provisioning Infrastructure

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

Currently, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is the only supported development environment. There
are [build container](docs/containers.md#building-inside-the-build-container)
instructions available for other OS distributions.

### Git LFS

This repo uses Git LFS to track larger files, such as FPGA bitstreams and DUT
provisioning firmware binaries. To properly clone this repo, ensure you have
Git LFS installed by:

1. adding the package cloud repository:

   ```shell
   curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
   ```
2. following the "Install Dependencies" instructions below.

   ```shell
   # Run the following command if this is the first time you are using lfs
   # in your target workstation.
   git lfs install

   # The following command can be used to pull  LFS files.
   # This may be required if you installed LFS after cloning the repo.
   git lfs pull
   ```

See the Git LFS [collaboration](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/collaboration-with-git-large-file-storage)
details on why this is necessary.

### Install Dependencies

Install dependencies via `setup.sh`. This will run `apt` to install system-level
dependencies, and install `bazelisk`, a Bazel wrapper that simplifies version
selection.

### Add bazelisk to PATH

Make sure to add `${GOPATH}/bin` to your path, e.g.:

```console
$ export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

### Runing Build Commands

To build and run all tests:

```console
$ bazelisk test //...
```

To run integration test cases:

```console
$ ./integration/run_pa_loadtest.sh
$ ./integration/run_client_tests.sh
```

To format the code before submitting changes:

```console
$ bazelisk run //quality:buildifier_fix
$ bazelisk run //quality:clang_format_fix
$ bazelisk run //quality:gofmt_fix
$ bazelisk run //quality:protolint_fix
```

To run only the lint checks locally that are also run in CI:

```console
$ bazelisk test //quality/...
```

Note: these are also run automatically when running all tests above.

## GitHub Releases

The release process assumes you have your git and
[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) credentials in `$HOME/.git` and
`$HOME/.config/gh` repsectively.

1. Commit your changes.
2. Create a tag locally before running the build command.

   ```console
   OT_GIT_TAG=v0.0.1pre1
   git tag ${OT_GIT_TAG}
   ```

3. Run the release command.  `util/get_workspace_status.sh` captures the git
   tag in the binaries when using the `--stamp` build flag.

   ```console
   $ bazelisk run --stamp //release -- ${OT_GIT_TAG} -p
   ```
