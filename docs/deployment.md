# Deployment Guide

## System Requirements

Currently, Ubuntu 22.04LTS is the only supported deployment environment. The
following steps need to be executed manually to prepare the system for
deployment. In the future, these steps will be migrated to Ansible scripts.

See [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)
for more details.

1. The following packages need to be installed before configuring the provisioning
services.

    ```console
    # Install system dependencies.
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install \
        openssl \
        ca-certificates \
        libssl-dev \
        podman \
        python3 \
        python3-pip \
        python3-setuptools \
        python3-wheel
    ```

## Service Deployment

The current deployment uses `podman play kube` to start the `spm` and `pa`
containers using `podman` as the container engine. The service configuration
is maintained in the Kubernetes
[config/containers/provapp.yml](../config/containers/provapp.yml)
configuration file.

A release consists of a `release_bundle.tar.xz` file and several container
image archives (`.tar` files). The following steps describe how to deploy the
services. It is assumed that `${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}` is set to the desired
installation directory (e.g., `/opt/opentitan-prov`).

1. Download release artifacts into a staging directory. The following
   instructions use `${STAGING_DIR}` to point to it. A typical release will
   contain the following files:

    ```
    fakeregistry_containers.tar
    provisioning_appliance_containers.tar
    proxybuffer_containers.tar
    release_bundle.tar.xz
    softhsm_dev.tar.xz
    ```
    > Note: Releases are available in GitHub: 
    > https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan-provisioning/releases
    > 
    > The release packages can be built using the following Bazel
    > Commands. Use the `prod` configuration when targeting production
    > deployments.
    >
    > ```
    >  # Can be set to `dev` or `prod`.
    >  export DEPLOY_ENV=prod
    >  bazelisk build //release:release_bundle --define "env=${DEPLOY_ENV}"
    >  bazelisk build //release:fakeregistry_containers_tar
    >  bazelisk build //release:provisioning_appliance_containers_tar
    >  bazelisk build //release:proxybuffer_containers_tar
    > ```

2. Prepare the deployment directories and copy the release artifacts. All
   services will be installed under the `${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}` directory.

    ```console
    # Create installation directories.
    $ sudo mkdir -p ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/release

    # Copy release bundle.
    $ sudo cp ${STAGING_DIR}/release_bundle.tar.xz ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/

    # Copy container images and other artifacts.
    $ sudo cp ${STAGING_DIR}/*_containers.tar ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/release/
    $ sudo cp ${STAGING_DIR}/softhsm_dev.tar.xz ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/release/
    ```

3. Extract the release bundle and configuration.

    ```console
    $ sudo tar xvf ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/release_bundle.tar.xz -C ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}
    $ sudo tar xvf ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/config.tar.gz -C ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}
    ```

4. Update the production environment variables to match your deployment configuration.
   The file will be located in the configuration target:

   ```
   # Production environment.
   ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/env/spm.env
   ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/env/spm.yml

   # Development environment.
   ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/env/spm.env
   ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/env/spm.yml
   ```

   The `spm.yml` may be deleted if opting for providing the HSM pin via other means.
   Make sure only the SPM user has access to the configuration files.

5. Run the deployment script. The script takes the deployment environment as an
   argument. This can be `prod` or `dev`.

    ```console
    $ export DEPLOY_ENV="prod"
    $ sudo ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/deploy.sh ${DEPLOY_ENV}
    Storing signatures
    Loaded image(s): localhost/pa_server:latest,localhost/spm_server:latest
    Launching containers
    Pod:
    cd208245e1d1195a7adfb073857cf2a4def9ecd9c7543a7af9906428ad536454
    Containers:
    48c834ed73f4153e9652a32dade2edc16f07dbc38ce1f55920e871907f155b98

    ```

6. Configure a `systemctl` service to restart the service on system reboot:

    ```console
    $ cp ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/provapp.service ~/.config/systemd/user/.
    $ systemctl --user enable provapp.service
    $ systemctl --user start provapp.service
    ```

7. (Optional) HSM Token Initialization

   If the deployment uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), the tokens must be
   initialized with the required cryptographic assets. This is a multi-step
   process that involves both an offline, air-gapped HSM and the online SPM HSM.

   Before you begin, you must configure the HSM settings by editing the
   environment file for your deployment. For a production environment, this file
   is located at:

   `${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/config/env/prod/spm.env`

   You must update the following variables in this file to match your HSM
   hardware and security policies:
   *   `SPM_HSM_TOKEN_SPM`: The name of the online SPM HSM token.
   *   `SPM_HSM_TOKEN_OFFLINE`: The name of the offline HSM token.
   *   `SPM_HSM_PIN_USER`: The user PIN for accessing the HSMs.
   *   `HSMTOOL_MODULE`: The absolute path to the HSM's PKCS#11 library
       (e.g., `/usr/safenet/lunaclient/lib/libCryptoki2_64.so`).
   *   See configuration file for other PKCS11 related settings.

   Once the `spm.env` file is configured, you can proceed with the
   initialization flow. This process is orchestrated by the `token_init.sh`
   script but requires manual intervention to transfer artifacts between the
   physically separate HSM environments.

   For a complete, step-by-step guide on this procedure, please refer to the
   [End to End SKU Provisioning Flow](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan-provisioning/wiki/hsm#end-to-end-sku-provisioning-flow)
   section in the HSM Configuration document.

8. (Optional) Use the following command to execute the PA server load test:

    ```console
    $ ${OPENTITAN_VAR_DIR}/release/loadtest \
        --enable_tls=false \
        --pa_address="localhost:5001" \
        --parallel_clients=20 \
        --total_calls_per_method=10
    ```

9. (Optional) Run the previous step after system reboot.

### Infra (pause) Container

In Kubernetes compatible deployments, the provisioning services run inside a
`pause` container whose main task is to maintain resource reservations for the
lifetime of the pod. The provisioning infrastructure packages a `podman_pause`
container to enable offline deployments. In order to enable the use of the
prepackaged `podman_pause` container, the following setting must be added to
the appropiate container configuration file:

```
[engine]
infra_image = "podman_pause:latest"
```

This is currently done by the deployment script, which configures the services
in rootless mode.

## Local Testing

The following steps can be used to test the install from a development environment:

```console
# The integation test invokes the deploy script to initialize the test environment.
# The following flags can be used:
# * --debug: Skips tearing down of containers. Useful if access to container logs
#   is required.
# * --prod: Builds and deploys the test environment using the test configuration.
#   This involves connecting to a physical HSM.
./integration/run_pa_loadtest.sh
```
